welcome to my github blog. I try to blog in more or less frequent intervals. When I'm writing stuff it will probably be about coding stuff and things. It may be aboaut angular, javascript, but also about php, typo3, symfony2 or anything like projects, project ideas or what ever comes to my mind.

Also this about page will probably be updated some day in the not so far future (hopefully). 

Build with jekyll and the [hyde theme](https://github.com/poole/hyde)
